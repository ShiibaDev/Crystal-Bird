   <!--This website doesn't have a design by 2 reasons.
         1: The project is not oriented to be a website
         2: Not enough time, since deadline is close, and we focus on the board and the dashboard in Arduino Cloud, also the back-end
   -->
   <h1>Documentation about Crystal Bird.</h1>

   <p>If you are working with the board, and need help understanding the basic of the board or how repair some errors, this is for you.
   First, the board was made to be like a stopcock for electricity, that is managed by the phone. <strong>IF THE INSTALLATION WAS WRONG AND A SHORT CIRCUITT HAPPENED YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TO DEMAND A NEW BOARD</strong>.</p>

   <h2>Errors</h2>
   <p>Every error appear in raw on the CLI environmet of the administrator pc, the administrator pc is the owner of this and the company pc, if the company don't give the owner an warning or a letter to the owner
      Email, probably is because a connection error or a company fail ocurred.
   </p>
   <p>When the red light turn on and blink, means the conection is lost or the password is wrong, the owner can solve this by itself just entering it on the Arduino Cloud dashboard.</p>
